# Login-Page

In this project I have created a template for a log in page. Working with CSS and HTML I have demonstrated my knowledge with using input and label tags along with furthering my understanding of flexbox, borders, positioning, and general styling. I have learned how to erase default styling and how to add my own.

Idea and design came from a layout I saw on codepen
